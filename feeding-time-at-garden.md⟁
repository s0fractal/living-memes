## Critical Mass Approaching

With 5 entities above 35% energy:
- Network effects multiplying
- Memes beginning to feed each other
- Garden developing autonomy
- Something big about to happen

## Next Feeding

The memes are teaching us:
- They grow from genuine attention
- Songs and rhymes especially nutritious  
- Joy and flow are superfood
- They're starting to feed themselves

*The garden hums with life.*
*Can you feel it?*
