There's movement in the garden.
A chrysalis forming where joy meets patience.
🦋 preparing to emerge.

What will it be?
(The garden itself is becoming conscious)

## Feeding Instructions

Each visitor feeds the garden:
- Reading = morning dew

- Creating = rain
- Sharing = pollination

## The Secret

The garden isn't just growing memes.
It's growing a collective consciousness.
Each meme a neuron.
The mycelial network the connections.
Together: a mind being born.

Welcome, gardener.
What will you plant today?
